Remote Deployment and Debugging
===============================

You can build on the local machine and copy the files to the Pi but you cannot debug on the local machine
because there is no PiIO library available. I find it easier to create a Samba share and have the solution
folder on the Pi. That way when I build the files are already on the Pi and I don't have to copy them manually.


For remote debugging I use MonoRemoteDebugger (https://github.com/techl/MonoRemoteDebugger)

I use the MonoRemoteDebugger.Server.exe on the Pi (run with "mono MonoRemoteDebugger.Server.exe"). I don't detach
from the CLI, I just leave the window minimized and use a second one for everything else. The server will give you
tracebacks if there any exceptions.
For VisualStudio I use the MonoRemoteDebugger add-in from Microsoft Marketplace 
(https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Bongho.MonoRemoteDebugger)

The two together let you deploy and do run-time debugging with a single menu item selection. What it doesn't do
is report build errors! So build normally first then choose "MonoRemoteDebugger->Debug with Mono (remote)".
