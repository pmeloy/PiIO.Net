I2C is fairly simple.

Add "using WiringPi;" to your usings section

Initialize WiringPi with 
	"Init.WiringPiSetup();"

Register your I2C Device and get a linux file handle for it with "int deviceHandle = I2C.Setup(Address)"
	Setup() will return either a valid handle or -1 with -1 meaning something went wrong.

That's all for setting up! Until the API docs are written use Intellisense. Just type "I2C." and the available methods and properties will appear.
